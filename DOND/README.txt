To run this application better, you need to register first 3 OCX's which you can download at - http://geocities.com/rdb_dvo/downloads/dondocx.zip -
Simply copy that link and paste in your web browser to begin download...
Unpack the compressed files... Then, run the application along with this zip in the folder "RegOCX"... Simply Drag and Drop all OCX's you've unpacked to the Register OCX application... When done, you can now run Deal Or No Deal game...
Note: This game is not for sale, it has a copyright in its rightful owners.. If you do (I hope I didn't), you might be done for it... I hope I didn't violate any law or anything...ü..
Also... I would like to acknowledge Endemol for the genius of the game.. Also to LaVolpe for the buttons (great buttons), Bryan Cairns for the Sound Player (cool codes), and Gene Martynov for the added features (volume control for sounds).
Enjoy!!!
